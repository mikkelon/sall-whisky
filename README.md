# sall-whisky
During our second semester of our Computer Science course we were given a project to develop a system for a whisky distillery.
The distillery wanted a system that could track their production history so that the entire history of a certain whisky product could be extracted.
Furthermore the distillery wanted a system for administrating their inventory.

The system was developed over the course of 5 weeks. The first week was entirely spent on business analysis, meaning the actual development took 4 weeks.
We used Unified Process to support our development.

The system never reached an actual production ready version. Neither was a database connected - however a SQL database was developed in the week after turning in the project.
